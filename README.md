#Blur Detection
A research paper for automatic blur detection in mobile captured document images. This research benchmarks several traditional blur detection techniques for scene image, and pinpoints the defections of these methods in mobile-captured document images. A new technique was proposed with the accuracy of 90% tested on 4,194 images. The paper was published on [IEEE ICIIP 2013, pp. 299-304, doi: 10.1109/ICIIP.2013.6707602](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=6707602).
